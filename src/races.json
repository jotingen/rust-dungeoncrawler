        "description": "Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.  Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.  Their hair, w orn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.",

A dwarf\u2019s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.  A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.",
